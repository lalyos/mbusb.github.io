With this latest version, you can boot ISOs directly from ISO. Once the live USB is made using multibootusb, simply copy ISOs to `/multibootusb/iso` directory. Thats it.
Therafter, boot to GRUB menu and select `Scan and Boot ISO` option. The menu files are copied from other project with same name [multibootusb](http://mbusb.aguslr.com/) by **Agus Lopez**.
His effort and work on the project is deeply acknowledged.


Other smaller but important cnanges includes:-

* Included missing EFI modules
* Fix for application crashing crashing on windows system 

**You must remove your old live USB install (delete multibootusb and EFI directory) before using this version.**

Go to [Download](http://multibootusb.org/page_download) page for download option...
